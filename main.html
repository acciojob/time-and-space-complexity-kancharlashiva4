    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a critical concept in computer science and algorithm analysis. It refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, typically measured in terms of the number of basic operations performed as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms have low time complexity, meaning they complete their tasks quickly, even for large inputs.

    <p>
        Space complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory or space an algorithm uses as it runs. This is also measured in relation to the input size. One common notation used for space complexity is O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. The space complexity of an algorithm helps us understand how much memory it requires, and it's essential for optimizing programs to use memory efficiently.
        <b>Space Complexity</b> is a crucial consideration when working with constrained resources.
