    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science and algorithm analysis. It refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete its task as a function of the size of its input. An algorithm is considered efficient if it has a low time complexity, meaning it can solve a problem quickly, even for large inputs.</p>
    
    <p>Space Complexity is another vital aspect of algorithm analysis. It quantifies the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to perform its task, also as a function of the input size. Space complexity is often denoted by Big O notation, such as <b>O(n)</b>, which signifies that the space used by the algorithm grows linearly with the input size. Managing space efficiently is critical in designing algorithms to avoid excessive memory usage.</p>
